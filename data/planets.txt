Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and has extreme temperature swings because it has almost no atmosphere to hold heat.

Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere that creates a runaway greenhouse effect; its surface is hotter than a pizza oven—around 460°C.

Earth is the only known planet with liquid water oceans on the surface and life. Its atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, and the magnetic field helps protect the surface from solar radiation.

Mars is colder and drier than Earth today, but shows evidence of ancient rivers and lakes. The thin atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. The largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is on Mars.

Jupiter is the largest planet, a gas giant with strong bands and storms; the Great Red Spot is a giant, centuries-old storm. Jupiter’s four large Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) are like mini-worlds.

Saturn is famous for its ring system, which is made of countless icy particles. Its moon Titan has thick atmosphere and lakes of methane and ethane.

Uranus rotates on its side, likely due to an ancient impact, giving it unusual seasons. Neptune is deep blue and has very strong winds, among the fastest in the solar system.

Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt with a heart-shaped plain called Sputnik Planitia. It has a thin atmosphere that freezes and thaws as it orbits the Sun.
