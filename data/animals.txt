Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of short bursts up to about 100–120 km/h, but they tire quickly and usually sprint for less than 30 seconds. Their claws are semi-retractable, which helps with traction like track spikes.

Peregrine falcons are the fastest animals in a dive. When they stoop (dive) from height, they can exceed 300 km/h. In level flight, they are not as fast as in a dive.

Blue whales are the largest animals known, weighing up to 150–180 metric tons and stretching 24–30 meters long. Despite their size, they feed mostly on krill—tiny shrimp-like animals—using baleen plates to filter huge mouthfuls of water.

Elephants show strong social bonds and impressive memory. Matriarchs often lead family groups and remember locations of water sources over long distances and years.

Bats and dolphins both use echolocation—sending out sound and listening for echoes—to navigate and hunt in low-visibility environments. Echolocation does not give “color” vision but gives excellent distance and shape cues.

Honeybees perform a “waggle dance” to tell nestmates where to find flowers. The dance encodes direction (relative to the sun) and distance (by duration of the waggle).
